DB credentials:

    add new server
    host name: db_campaign
    port: 54320
    db: postgres
    user: admin
    password: secret

API:

DB:
pool_size and max_overflow https://stackoverflow.com/a/9999411


Update Db and insert master data:
python run_db.py auto
python run_db.py data

### The parsing of data and  loading of data to the database will happen while starting the fastapi server when "data_loader" table will have "true" status for "Movie Data Loading"

For manual upload of data with parsing run in docker terminal:

python parse.py 

NB: ** manual parsing is not included optional "phrase 4", "phrase 4" only runs at startup.

When the database is ready with the parsed data, "data_loader" table will have "false" status for "Movie Data Loading" so that the data parsing & loading never happens again.

### Phrase 4 will run while starting the fastapi server when "data_loader" table will have "true" status for "Movie Rating Loading"

change the db value for enable/disable phrase 4. 

did not exposed an api for "data_loader" table's status change, because of maintaining exact api deliverables by the assignment requirements.
